But did you try it?\n\n\nRead Receipt\n\nEver wondered if your email has been seen? Our Read Receipt feature eliminates the guesswork. With just one click, you can send a notification to your email recipients, letting them know you've seen their message. This simple yet powerful tool reassures senders that their message has not gone unnoticed, fostering a more responsive and transparent communication environment.\n\n\nI'll Reply Later\n\nWe understand that you're not always able to respond to emails immediately. The 'I'll Reply Later' option allows you to inform senders with a single click that you've received their email and will get back to them at a later time. This feature helps manage expectations and keeps the communication line open, ensuring senders that their message is important to you.\n\n\nWant to learn more? You can read our article.\n\n\nHappy sending!\n\nTom\n\n-- "]
